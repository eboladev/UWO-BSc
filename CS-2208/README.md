Fundamentals of Computer Organization
=======

Course Description
------------------
Computer architecture; data representations; hardware; memory management; instruction sets; exposure to an assembly language for a RISC machine; assembly and linking. 

Assignments
-----------

- **Assignment 1:** Written assignment dealing with binary arithmetic, basic computer architecture, etc (no code written)
- **Assignment 2:** Basic SPARC assembly programming and using GDB for debugging
- **Assignment 3:** More complex SPARC assembly programming including functions. Implements a Base64 encoder
- **Assignment 4:** Investigating the Java Virtual Machine and writing bytecode. Implements a simple JVM in SPARC assembly and simple bytecode programs
- **Assignment 5:** Investigating assemblers and linkers. A partially completed assembler was provided along with a CPU simulator. The assembler was finished and plugins that were dynamically linked during run time were implemented. Finally simple assembly language programs were created that could be assembled by the custom assembler and run on the custom CPU simulator

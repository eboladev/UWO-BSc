Data Structures and Algorithms
=======

Course Description
------------------

The purpose of this course is to provide the students with solid foundations in the basic concepts of programming: data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems that they might encounter. This course is also about showing the correctness of algorithms and studying their computational complexities. This course offers the students a mixture of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. 

The study of data structures and algorithms is carried out within an object-oriented framework. When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used. 

Topics covered in this course include:
- analysis of algorithms
- dictionaries, hash tables
- trees, binary search trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, B-trees
- graphs, graph traversals, graph algorithms
- sorting

Assignments
-----------

- **Assignment 1:** Implements a compression algorithm to reduce the size of an input file. The program uses a modified version of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to construct a tree based dictionary and compress the input file.
- **Assignment 2:** Implements a dictionary using a binary tree. The dictionary is populated from an input file that contains words and then either text, audio, or picture descriptions. The user can search for words in the dictionary, read/listen/display a word's description, get predecessor and successors of words, and delete words.
- **Assignment 3:** Implements a maze solving program. The program reads in a "labyrinth" file and constructs a graph to represent all of the rooms and hallways of the maze. The program then finds a path from the start of the maze to the end of the maze using a depth-first search algorithm and shows the path with a provided graphical interface.

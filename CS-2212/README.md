Introduction to Software Engineering 
=======

Course Description
------------------

The informal approaches that most individual programmers use when writing small programs do not work very well when applied to the development of large pieces of software and team programming situations. Software engineering is, according to the author of the text for this course, ''the process of solving customers' problems by the systematic development and evolution of large, high-quality software systems within cost, time and other constraints''.

In this course, we will examine the stages of the software engineering process, including requirements gathering, specification, design, implementation and testing. The principles of object-oriented design and analysis and user interface design will be stressed, and the concept of software design patterns will be introduced. UML (Unified Modeling Language), the standard tool for expressing designs in software engineering, will be introduced. All programming for this course will be done in Java.

Topics to be covered include:

- Software process models
- PERT and Gantt charts
- OO Review
- UML Use Case Diagrams
- UML Class Diagrams
- Design Patterns
- White box and black box testing, testing coverage tools
- UML state diagrams and sequence diagrams
- Coupling and Cohesion Issues
- Using Java to create GUIs
- Code Repositories and Debuggers

Individual Assignment
---------------------

The individual assignment is designed to give an introduction to Java Swing which will be needed for the main group project. The individual project implements a two player hangman game with a graphical interface as a Windows application (using Java Swing). When the game is started a category is selected and each player enters a puzzle. The players then take turns solving each other's puzzles by guessing letters. The players are also able to switch between multiple colour schemes for the GUI.
